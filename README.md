This repository showcases a unique approach to animation by generating procedural animations that adapt to user input in real-time. Unlike the traditional method of looping through fixed frames, the animation here is dynamic and influenced by the player’s movements and interactions.

The procedural animation technique used in this game creates a fluid, responsive experience that is both interactive and engaging. The player’s movements and actions directly affect the way the game entities behave, offering a more immersive gameplay experience.
